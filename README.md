In "src" there is the java file, in "cs413" there are the php files (which is what we will run in the project).

Java file is needed to initialize the database and insert tuples.
You don't need to do anything with this file if you don't want to insert new employees or companies. If you do, then you need to download jdbc driver (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) and add it to your java project as an external library before you can run this java file.
